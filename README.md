# Our Illustrations

This is a collaboration over some illustrations we both designed while being stuck at home during the corona-virus lockdown. We designed these while learning adobe illustrator basics. We used photoshop for some of the tweaks and changes too.

One evening we were talking about showcasing these learning bits of arts, so we decided to host it on github. Then we thought some like-minded people might also like to collaborate over this so we open sourced the code and the project here. So, we are open to collaborations here. (See [contributing](#contributing) for more details)
